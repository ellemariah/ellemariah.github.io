<h2>Voyant Text Analysis</h2>
<p>Feminism is currently a hotly-debated topic. Many people claim to be feminists, while others believe feminism is ridiculous and unnecessary.</p>
<p>For my project, I chose to analyze ten articles from popular women's magazines and ten articles from popular men's magazines. I therefore created two separate Voyant pages, which I'll compare. When I looked up the articles, I used the "search" function with the word "feminism" (or "feminist" if the previous didn't appear). I then chose the first article that contained a significant amount of text (5+ paragraphs).</p>
<p>I'm not very familiar with the Voyant tool, so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. One thing I did notice was that in the word clouds, the words "feminism" or "feminist" popped up fairly large and obvious, while in the men's word clouds, I didn't even see the word "feminism," even though I pulled articles from both groups that appeared under the search "feminism." Below is the women's word cloud, and then the men's. If you need a larger view, feel free to export each word cloud, which will open in a new page.</p>

<p>The above observation led me to look at the Contexts tool. For the women's magazines, "feminism" has 22 results and related to what people think feminism means, as well as the importance of talking about feminism (see Contexts tool below). For the men's magazines, "feminism" had 10 results, and related to how that term can be intimidating and doesn't appear very digestible.

<p>To a point, this result is what I might have expected. Men's magazines don't talk about feminism as much as women's, and when they do, they're a little bit scared of what they think it means, or beyond that, they're not even sure what it means. 
  </p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure how to interpret this data, but in relation to men being nervous or uninterested when it comes to feminism, I noticed that the men's articles include almost double the word count of the women's, and yet the men's magazines mention feminism less. These results could absolutely be skewed by my method of selecting articles, but I've personally noticed that feminism seems to be a "women's issue" and that while a good number of men are self-proclaimed feminists, many either don't like feminism or don't care about it. The women's word count is below, followed by the men's.</p>

  <p>Conclusion. What do my findings reveal?
