<h2>Voyant Text Analysis</h2>
<p>Feminism is currently a hotly-debated topic. Many people claim to be feminists, while others believe feminism is ridiculous and unnecessary.</p>
<p>For my project, I chose to analyze ten articles from popular women's magazines and ten articles from popular men's magazines. I therefore created two separate Voyant pages, which I'll compare. When I looked up the articles, I used the "search" function with the word "feminism" (or "feminist" if the previous didn't appear). I then chose the first article that contained a significant amount of text (5+ paragraphs).</p>
<p>I'm not very familiar with this tool, so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. One thing I did notice was that in the word clouds, the words "feminism" or "feminist" popped up larger and more obvious than in the men's word clouds, even though I pulled articles from both groups that appeared under the search "feminism." Below is the women's word cloud, and then the men's.</p>
