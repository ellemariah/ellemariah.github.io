<h2>Voyant Text Analysis</h2>
<p>Feminism is currently a hotly-debated topic. Many people claim to be feminists, while others believe feminism is ridiculous and unnecessary.</p>
<p>For my project, I chose to analyze ten articles from popular women's magazines and ten articles from popular men's magazines. I therefore created two separate Voyant pages, which I'll compare. When I looked up the articles, I used the "search" function with the word "feminism" (or "feminist" if the previous didn't appear). I then chose the first article that contained a significant amount of text (5+ paragraphs).</p>
<p>I'm not very familiar with the Voyant tool, so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. One thing I did notice was that in the word clouds, the words "feminism" or "feminist" popped up fairly large and obvious, while in the men's word clouds, I didn't even see the word "feminism," even though I pulled articles from both groups that appeared under the search "feminism." However, the word "women" is the largest word in both clouds. Below is the women's word cloud, and then the men's. If you need a larger view, feel free to export each word cloud, which will open in a new page.</p>

<p>This observation led me to look at the Contexts tool. For the women's magazines, "feminism" has 22 results and related to what people think feminism means, as well as the importance of talking about feminism (see Contexts tool below). For the men's magazines, "feminism" had 10 results, and how terms can be intimidating and doesn't appear very digestible.
