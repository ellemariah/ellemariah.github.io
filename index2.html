<h1>Coalition to End Sexual Exploitation</h1>
<h2>2016 Conference</h2>
<p>The Coalition to End Sexual Exploitation is a conference I attended in both 2015 and 2016. People come from all over the country to share their knowledge about the harms of pornography, prostitution, sex trafficking, and other aspects of the sex industry.</p>
<p>Below are some helpful resources I obtained both at the conference and throughout my own research:</p>
